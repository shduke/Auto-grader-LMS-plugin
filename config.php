// Important - to communicate to the Tsugi library that we are a
// standalone application using cookie-based sessions we need this line
// before we include config.php

if ( !defined('COOKIE_SESSION') ) define('COOKIE_SESSION', true);

// It is possible to set this up when it is not running on the same
// server as the Tsugi management console.   In that case, take the
// config-dist.php from Tsugi and set up the configuration in this folder.
// You will need to manually set up the database tables and do
// administration tasks manually as well.
//
// You also will need to include the above COOKIE_SESSION line in that
// config.php file to tell the Tsugi library that we want to cookie-based
// session.

// There is some documentation on this more complex installation setup at
